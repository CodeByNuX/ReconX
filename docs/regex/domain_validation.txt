    ^(?!-)([A-Za-z0-9-]{1,63}\.)+[A-Za-z]{2,63}$

Options: Case sensitive; Exact spacing; Dot doesn’t match line breaks; ^$ don’t match at line breaks; Regex syntax only

* [Assert position at the beginning of the string][1] `^`
* [Assert that it is impossible to match the regex below starting at this position (negative lookahead)][2] `(?!-)`
    * [Match the character “-” literally][3] `-`
* [Match the regex below and capture its match into backreference number 1][4] `([A-Za-z0-9-]{1,63}\.)+`
    * [Between one and unlimited times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed (greedy)][5] `+`
        * [You repeated the capturing group itself.  The group will capture only the last iteration.  Put a capturing group around the repeated group to capture all iterations.][6] `+`
        * [Or, if you don’t want to capture anything, replace the capturing group with a non-capturing group to make your regex more efficient.][6]
    * [Match a single character present in the list below][7] `[A-Za-z0-9-]{1,63}`
        * [Between one and 63 times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed (greedy)][8] `{1,63}`
        * [A character in the range between “A” and “Z” (case sensitive)][7] `A-Z`
        * [A character in the range between “a” and “z” (case sensitive)][7] `a-z`
        * [A character in the range between “0” and “9”][7] `0-9`
        * [The literal character “-”][3] `-`
    * [Match the character “.” literally][9] `\.`
* [Match a single character present in the list below][7] `[A-Za-z]{2,63}`
    * [Between 2 and 63 times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed (greedy)][8] `{2,63}`
    * [A character in the range between “A” and “Z” (case sensitive)][7] `A-Z`
    * [A character in the range between “a” and “z” (case sensitive)][7] `a-z`
